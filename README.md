## Hey, XY is here ðŸ‘‹

- I am an undergraduate at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen ([CUHKSZ](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en)), majoring in bioinformatics.
- I am currently learning at the [Warshel Institute of Computational Biology](https://warshel.cuhk.edu.cn/).
- I am interested in genomics and genetics, focusing on auto-immune diseases.

It's heard that people always want to have their own homepages. _Creating a repo with their own names_ and _introducing themselves_ in `README.md` is a wise choice.
